If get funded, Dash would be in our first line coins list in future.

In the next half year, we would add more features about order managment, chat and social, handle system and listing improvement etc. After more optimization, we would collaborate with publishers with huge traffic in social network for publicity.

We may do more support for virtual/digit goods etc. in future.
